1. I would place the automated tests in option 2 Recipe project development pipeline. It is so because testing the product while development because there might be a chance that other functions are dependant on the previous functions. And if we don't particularly check if the first function, then it would cause an unnecessary trouble on the dependant part of code which can create a lot of trouble because a little error can cause the code to not work at all.
2. Yes
3. No, we wouldn't use the unit test to test the “message” feature of a messaging application because it is the end development goal of the application and not for unit testing.
4. Yes, we would use a unit test to test the “max message length” feature because we have a constraint which doesn't allow more than 80 characters for a particular message.
